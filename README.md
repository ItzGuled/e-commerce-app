# E-commerce App

## The Motivation

This challenge was a pleasure to get done. I really learned how to use routes and format models to make a e-commerce backend. I furthered my understanding of Sequelize and its interaction with the MySQL database. 

## Challenges

Getting all routes to work took some trial and error. The crud operations for each route kept giving me errors and getting the right task to happen was a little difficult. Also this challenge has increased my awareness of what to look for when errors arise in these apps with numerous files.
